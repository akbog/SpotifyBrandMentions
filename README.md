# SpotifyBrandMentions
In this project, we analyze the daily occurrence of luxury brand mentions in Spotify’s most streamed songs and model the relationship between a brand’s occurrences in popular songs with the  brand’s popularity, as measured by Google Trends. This is a repository of notebooks and code used to perform our analysis.
